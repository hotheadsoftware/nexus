# Contributing to Nexus

Welcome to the Nexus Community!

We're thrilled you're considering contributing to Nexus! This document provides guidelines and advice 
for contributing to our project. Nexus is committed to fostering an open, welcoming, and inclusive 
environment. We value all contributions, whether it's coding, documentation, design, or spreading the word.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

Search for Existing Issues: Before creating a new issue, please do a search in GitHub issues to see if the 
issue or feature request has already been filed.

Create a New Issue: If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to 
include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an 
executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Making Changes

Fork the Repository: Fork the project repository to your GitHub account.

Create a Branch: Create a new branch from main in your fork for your changes. Keep your changes as focused 
as possible. If there are multiple changes you'd like to make, consider submitting them in separate branches
and pull requests.

Commit Your Changes: Write clear, concise commit messages. Include the motivation for the change and contrast 
its implementation with previous behavior.

### Submitting Changes

Open a Pull Request: After you've made your changes, open a pull request (PR) against the `testing` branch 
of the Nexus repository.

Code Review: Once your PR is opened, maintainers and contributors will review it. Be open to suggestions and feedback.

Merge: Once your PR is approved, a maintainer will merge it. Your changes will appear in our `main` branch 
during the next release window, and be assigned to a tagged version shortly thereafter. 

## Code of Conduct

Our Code of Conduct can be summarized as: Don't Be a Dick. We expect friendly and respectful interactions between
participants at all times. If you're upset about something, walk it out or talk it out; do not take it out on 
others. The goal here is to build something great with one another. Regardless of origin, identity, or beliefs, 
all contributors and users are welcome to share their achievements, hopes, and concerns as they regard the Nexus 
project. 

While we advocate for and believe deeply in the freedoms of association and thought, Contributors who become
problematic for the project due to recent public statements or behaviors may be asked to step away to avoid 
harm to the project itself.

# ADR 009: Blank Canvas

## Status

Accepted - 2024-01-17

## Context

Nexus started as a "the works" service, intending to completely provide end to end
functionality as I was envisioning it. This led me to create multiple panels in
advance, trying to anticipate need. 

## Decision

Nexus will provide 2 panels: 

| Panel   | Description                                                                               |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Admin   | Used by the software team to deliver, monitor, and support the application as a platform. |
| Account | Used by subscribers to manage the subscription & global settings.                         |

## Consequences

Users will need to determine their own conventions for the tenant-context panels, including how many
user tiers are required, and whether or not any given user type has more than one panel. The learning
curve is shifted to "how do you want to run your business" rather than "how do you build an app?"

## Alternatives Considered

We initially provided Admin and Account panels in the central context, but gave an example panel
called Operate in the tenant context. This caused some minor debate as to how it should be named,
given the various ways it could be used. Rather than imply a specific use case, we decided to
provide a blank canvas and let the user decide.
